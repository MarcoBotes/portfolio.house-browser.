## Project Requirement
Develop a property viewing application with a navigation element that allows you to click on each room individually to navigate to different pages.

### Bonus:
Some extra self imposed challenges I wanted to explore
- Execute in Next.js
- Server Side rendering for the pages
- Working API

## Project Execution

After a very small amount of research I came across a library to render complex canvas', [Konva](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.html). After reading through the documentation the plan was to create an image with an element overlay that accomodates *hover* and *click* events.

With absolutely no design in mind and very little UI / UX experience - I set off to create a UI that wouldn't keep my up at night.
